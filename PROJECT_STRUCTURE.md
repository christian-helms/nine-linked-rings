## Design Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns

The project uses a **custom root-level structure** rather than following IsaacLab's `scripts/` convention for these reasons:

1. **Clear Workflow Separation:** Each major workflow (teleoperation, learning, evaluation) has its own top-level directory
2. **Shared Resources:** Environment configs in `environments/` can be used by any workflow
3. **Research-Friendly:** Easier to navigate and understand for collaborators
4. **Flexibility:** Not constrained by IsaacLab's generic structure

### Import Patterns

**Environments:**
```python
from environments.nine_rings_inspire_env_cfg import NineRingsInspireEnvCfg
```

**Retargeters:**
```python
from teleoperation.retargeters.manus_vive_inspire_retargeter_cfg import (
    ManusViveInspireRetargeter,
    ManusViveInspireRetargeterCfg,
)
```

**Utilities:**
```python
from teleoperation.recording_utils import DemonstrationRecorder
```

## Module Descriptions

### `environments/`

Contains environment configurations that define:
- Robot articulation (RM75 Inspire hand)
- Scene layout (Nine Linked Rings puzzle)
- Physics settings
- Observation/action spaces
- Reward functions (for RL)

**Purpose:** Shared across teleoperation, training, and evaluation

### `teleoperation/`

Contains teleoperation-specific code:
- **`retargeters/`**: Maps hand tracking â†’ robot commands
- **`teleop_nine_rings.py`**: Main teleoperation loop
- **`recording_utils.py`**: Records demonstrations for IL
- **`demo_viewer.py`**: Visualizes recorded demonstrations
- **`config_example.py`**: Example retargeter configurations

**Purpose:** Human-in-the-loop data collection

### `learning/`

Future home for training scripts:
- Imitation learning (BC, DAgger, etc.)
- Reinforcement learning (PPO, SAC, etc.)
- Training configurations
- Model checkpoints

**Purpose:** Policy learning from demonstrations or interaction

### `evaluation/`

Future home for evaluation tools:
- Policy evaluation scripts
- Success rate metrics
- Benchmarking tools
- Visualization

**Purpose:** Quantitative assessment of learned policies

## Workflow Examples

### Teleoperation

```bash
# Record expert demonstrations
cd /home/chris/nine-linked-rings
uv run teleoperation/teleop_nine_rings.py --record

# View recorded demonstration
uv run teleoperation/demo_viewer.py demonstrations/demo_*.pkl --plot
```

### Future: Training (Example)

```bash
# Train BC policy from demonstrations
uv run learning/train_bc.py --demo_dir demonstrations/ --epochs 100

# Evaluate trained policy
uv run evaluation/eval_policy.py --policy_path checkpoints/bc_policy.pt
```

## Migration from `scripts/`

The `scripts/` folder contains IsaacLab's reference implementations. As we develop custom workflows:

1. âœ… Environment configs â†’ `environments/`
2. âœ… Teleoperation â†’ `teleoperation/`
3. ðŸ”„ Learning scripts â†’ `learning/` (as needed)
4. ðŸ”„ Evaluation â†’ `evaluation/` (as needed)

The `scripts/` folder will remain for reference and can be gradually cleaned up.

## Key Features

### Environment

- **19 DOF Control:** 7 arm + 12 hand (thumb: 4, fingers: 8)
- **Proper Physics:** Isaac Lab environment with collision detection
- **Gymnasium Registration:** Optional `gym.make()` support

### Retargeting

- **Full Hand Mapping:** Direct joint-to-joint for all 5 fingers
- **Configurable:** Sensitivity, smoothing, per-finger scaling
- **Production Ready:** Robust error handling, validation

### Recording

- **Comprehensive Data:** Actions, observations, robot state, raw hand data
- **Multiple Formats:** Pickle, JSON, NPZ
- **Metadata:** Timestamps, duration, statistics

### Visualization

- **Auto-Detection:** Handles both 19 DOF (Inspire) and 7 DOF (Franka)
- **Grouped Plots:** Arm, thumb, fingers separately
- **Statistics:** Joint ranges, duration, frequency

- **`teleoperation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: Technical details
- **`teleoperation/ENVIRONMENT_REGISTRATION.md`**: Registration guide
- **`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`** (this file): Organization

## Next Steps

1. **Collect Demonstrations:** Use teleoperation to record expert data
2. **Implement Learning:** Add BC/IL algorithms in `learning/`
3. **Add Evaluation:** Create metrics and benchmarks in `evaluation/`
4. **Cleanup:** Gradually remove unused `scripts/` files
